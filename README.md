## Here are the functions:
1. Define a function, as a function declaration, maxOfTwoNumbers that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. If they are the same, return that number. Use the if-else construct or a ternary expression - the Math.max method is not allowed.
2. Define a function, as a function expression, maxOfThree that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Again, the Math.max method is not allowed.
3. Define a function, as a function declaration, isCharAVowel that takes a character as an argument and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.
4. Define a function, as a function expression, sumArray that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of those numbers. For example, sumArray([2, 4, 5]);would return 11.
5. Define a function, as a function declaration, multiplyArray that takes an array of numbers and returns the product those numbers. For example, multiplyArray([2, 4, 5]);would return 40.
6. Define a function, as a function expression, numArgs that returns the number of arguments passed to the function when called.
7. Define a function, as a function declaration, reverseString that takes a string, reverses the characters, and returns it. For example, reverseString('rockstar');would return the string "ratskcor".
8. Define a function, as a function expression, longestStringInArray that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns the length of the longest string.
9. Define a function, as a function declaration, stringsLongerThan that takes an array of strings and a number as arguments; and returns an array of the strings that are longer than the number passed in. For example, stringsLongerThan(['say', 'hello', 'in', 'the', 'morning'], 3);would return ["hello", "morning"].
10. Bonus Not from before Define a function called makeItRainthat takes in any number of arguments of type number and prints out I got (sum of all numbers) dollars in my pocket, I'm 'bout to make it rain!!!!and then returns the sum of all the numbers. For example makeitRain(3,4,6,7) will return 20 and will print out I got 20 dollars in my pocket, I'm 'bout to make it rain!!!!
